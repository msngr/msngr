# About Me

## Web Developer For Pixel Perfect Responsive Websites,<br>SPAs And Web Apps

Hello, my name is Sergej and I'm a web developer, currently building a one-man agency for website development and maintenance.

About me:

1. 2020 I quit my job as a CNC machining mechanic, taught myself web development and built my first website.
2. 2021 I started my [own business](https://webdesign-sorgenfrei.w3bdev.de), developing websites for small companies and freelancers.
3. 2022 I decided to give up my business, specialized in frontend web development and later had an internship at [Lambda IT-Solution](https://www.lambda-it.de/).
4. June â€“ November 2022 I worked remotely at [cierra GmbH](https://cierra.de/) and learned about big projects, web apps and a little backend development.
5. 2023 I was building my second business readysite.online with a different strategy, but discarded the idea and worked again in my former professional field.
6. 2024 I decided to give it another try and resume my career in the wide field of IT, earning two Microsoft certifications.
7. 2025 I chose to continue with my second business idea, combining it with my first business and AI technologies to offer smart websites.
