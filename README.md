# About Me

## Frontend Web Developer For Pixel Perfect Responsive Websites,<br>SPAs And Web Apps

Hello, my name is Sergej and I'm a developer, currently restarting my IT carrier and looking for job opportunities.

About me:

1. I quit my job and taught myself Web Development in 2020.
2. In 2021 I started my [own business](https://webdesign-sorgenfrei.w3bdev.de), developing websites for smaller companies and freelancers.
3. 2022 I had an internship and decided to give up my business and specialised in Frontend Development.
4. 2022 June until November I worked remotely at [cierra GmbH](https://cierra.de/).
5. 2023 I was building my second business readysite.online with a different strategy, but discarded the idea and worked again in my former professional field.
6. 2024 I decided to give it another try and to proceed my carrier in the wide field of IT.
